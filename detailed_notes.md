# Detailed Course Notes

## Lesson 1 - Introduction to Cloud Native Fundamentals

* Cloud native - refers to practices using which the applications run in cloud environment.
* Benefits of cloud native -
    * Faster and easier application scaling.
    * Higher feature velocity.
    * Innovating with technology ecosystem.
* Types of cloud environments -
    * Private cloud
    * Public cloud
    * Hybrid cloud
* Containers - are small units of application.
* Benefits of containers -
    * Follows single application principle.
    * Easy to manage.

    * Faster recovery from downtime.
* Microservices - are collection of small and independent services or applications.
* Types of container managers or orchestrators -
    * Kubernetes
    * Docker swarm
    * Apache mesos
* Kubernetes - is a container orchestrator that automates:
    * Configuration
    * Management
    * Scalability
* Kubernetes also integrates with -
    * Runtime
    * Networking
    * Storage
    * Service mesh
    * Logs and metrics
    * Tracing
* CNCF - Cloud native computing foundation is a home to open source projects that provide tools for running an application cloud environment.
* Cloud native adoption requires two things -
    * Business perspective -
        * Agility
        * Growth
        * Service availability
    * Technical perspective -
        * Automation
        * Orchestration
        * Observability
